Version 3.10.0
   Fix bug in matlab interface affecting cases with multiple right-hand sides.

2014-02-07  Jonathan Hogg
Version 3.9.0
   Substantial rewrite of matlab/ma57_solve.f90. This fixes a bug where
   ma57_solve() didn't accept multiple right-hand sides. It also massively
   simplifies the code through proper use of newer HSL_MATLAB routines.

2013-03-26  Jonathan Hogg
Version 3.8.0
   Replace calls to FD15 with F95 intrinsics.
   Ensure ISNPIV is defined before accessing it (innocous bug found by nagfor)

2013-03-20  Jonathan Hogg
Version 3.7.1
   Update MATLAB install to handle version 8.0 and higher. Minor
   cleanup of other things relating to MATLAB interface.

2011-05-05  Mario Arioli
Version 3.7.0 Add MATLAB interface
   Based on old beta test version, but updated to use new hsl_matlab 2.0
   functionality.

2011-01-24  Iain Duff
Version 3.6.0
    Two minor bugs corrected.  INFO(40) is now initialized to
    zero and the test on the value of PHASE is separated
    from that on ICNTL(7) at statement 29 to ensure PHASE
    has been set before it is tested.

2010-08-28
Version 3.5.0
   Fixed bug when insufficient space left to move
   off-diagonal entries of two by two pivots at end of
   factorization. Corrected computation of INFO(18) on
   error return from MA57B/BD.  Corrected computation of
   INFO(20) after return from MA57O/OD.

2009-11-30
Version 3.4.0
   Fixed bug when using MA27 ordering (MA57VD/MA57HD) that
   was caused because no elbow room was allowed by MA57AD
   when there were no entries on diagonal of input matrix.
   Fix was to use different pointer within array KEEP for
   this ordering.

2009-09-03
Version 3.3.0
   Some typos corrected in comments.
   Length given to array IW in MA57K/KD (called from MA57A/AD
   as IKEEP(IFCT)) increased to avoid problem when order
   of matrix is greater than number of entries.
   Value of dropping control (ICNTL(16)) is now printed
   on entry to MA57B/BD.
   Bug in ordering from MA27 corrected in MA57H/HD (was
   previously identical to MA27H/HD).
   Test now made to check space if less than N pivots are
   chosen at end of MA57O/OD whatever the reason (previously
   was only done if ICNTL(16) was equal to 1).
   INFO/RINFO parameters now all initialized to zero on
   entry to MA57O/OD so that they have a valid value in the
   case of an error return.

2007-09-19
Version 3.2.0
   New option added (ICNTL(16)) that allows the removal of
   blocks of small entries to the end of the factorization.
   Is particularly powerful when matrix is severely rank
   deficient.  Numerous other mainly cosmetic changes that
   don't affect interface.

2007-08-03
Version 3.1.0
   The new version of MC47 (that incorporates an updated
   version of MC50 is used).

2006-12-01
Version 3.0.2
   Comments adjusted to meet the 72-character limit.

2005-06-15
Version 3.0.1
   Setting of ALENB in MA57B/BD moved before first error exit to avoid
   undefined variable if error invoked.  INFO(1) initialized to zero in
   call to MA57C/CD.

2005-03-02
Version 3.0.0 A new option has been added for ordering the matrix.
   If ICNTL(6) is equal to 5 then the ordering chosen depends on the matrix
   characteristics.
   At the moment the choices are MC50 or METIS. INFO(36) is set to ordering
   used. A minor change has been made to the pivot control to reduce   the amount
   of researching on failed pivots (resetting of KR).
   FD05 dependence changed to FD15.

2004-12-13
Version 2.3.0 Several minor changes after field testing.
   Scale factors (RINFO(16) and RINFO(17) set to 1
   if scaling not used.
   Option to handle dense columns invoked for METIS ordering.
   Value of SCHNAB(1) set to 1. to allow Schnabel-Eskow to
   work on matrix with a rows of zeros.
   Some diagnostic printing and STOP statements removed from
   MC50.

2004-11-04
Version 2.2.1
   Change to assembly of reals in MA57O/OD leading to more efficient code at
   suggestion of Stephane Pralet.

2004-09-10
Version 2.2.0
   Defaults for ICNTL(6), ICNTL(9) and
   CNTL(5) changed. Scaling factors (optionally) printed.

2004-09-01
Version 2.1.0 Default changed to static pivoting off.

2004-07-31
Version 2.0.0 established at HSL 2004 release.

2004-07-20
Several changes incorporated for HSL 2004 code.
   Removed unused INT,ABS from MA57U/UD
   INFO(32), INFO(33), and INFO(34) added
   INFO(32): no. of zeros in the triangle of the factors
   INFO(33): no. of zeros in the rectangle of the factors
   INFO(34): no. of zero columns in rectangle of the factors
   Static pivoting available (controlled by CNTL(4), CNTL(5))
   Scaling using symmetrized MC64 (ICNTL(15))
   Links to METIS_NODEND ordering

2004-07-12
Version 1.0.0 Version numbering added.

2004-05-24
Statement functions in MA57U/UD replaced by in-line code.

2003-03-25
MC50 (AMD with dense row protection) and MA27 (minimum degree) added.
   Invoked by ICNTL(6) equal to 2 and 3,
   respectively. Routines MA57H/HD, MA57V/VD, and MA57Z/ZD
   have been added to duplicate routines MA27H/HD, MA27G/GD,
   and MA27U/UD from MA57 and MC50B/BD is another internal
   routine of MA57. ICNTL(14) has been added to control
   density of rows regarded as dense by the MC50 and MA27
   orderings.

2002-12-06
The test for convergence of iterative refinement changed to
   avoid any problem with comparisons of numbers held in
   registers.

2001-12-20
INFO(1) initialized to zero in MA57E/ED

2001-10-26
Printing controls corrected to ensure ICNTL(5) is used and
   unit number always checked for being positive before
   printing. Text and comments changed to reflect that D
   inverse is held in factors and text for solution changed
   from Right-hand side to solution.
   Option of choosing two 1 x 1 pivots when 2 x 2 fails
   removed.
   MC47B/BD given remaining length in KEEP to avoid compresses

2001-07-04
Use of MC41 changed to use of MC71.

2001-02-06
Default values for ICNTL(12) and ICNTL(13) changed.
   Control for direct addressing in solve changed to be
   on number of rows and number columns in block pivot.
   Several comments changed as consequence.
   INFO(31) added to record number of block pivots.
   Subroutines MA57X/XD and MA57Y/YD added for efficiency when
   only one rhs (equivalent to MA57Q/QD and MA57R/RD resp).

2000-11-01
Entries in IW initialized to zero in MA57O/OD to avoid copy
   of unassigned variables by MA57E/ED.
   AINPUT and IINPUT reset in call to MA57E/ED.
